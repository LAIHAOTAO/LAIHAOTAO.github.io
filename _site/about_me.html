    <h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
    <p>The following paragraphy will be something about myself, if you don&#39;t have time to read the them, you may be interested in my <a href="http://laihaotao.github.io/documents/cv_english.pdf">CV</a> please click here.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello, dear visitors. My name is Haotao Lai, also you can call me Eric. <strong><em>My dream is to become a software engineer. Now, I am foucus on Android, Java and web development.</em></strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m from China, now as a senior student in Guangzhou University (expected graduate in 2016), majored in Mechanical Automation Engineering. Rather than ME, I find my real interest in Software Engineering, specically in mobile and web applicant developments. I notcied that when I learned <q>C Language</q> although it wasn&#39;t my faviource language, I still really thanks it to bring me in the coding world. I believe that would be my career life. Programming is an amazing and charming job, it requires an clear brain and strong logical thinking. I like challenge and enjoy the feeling when I figure out some diffcult problems. So, I spend my spare time in learing programming, in all languages what I like best is java. Now I am foucus on android, java and web development(that is an order list). Because I do not really learning software engineering, now I am trying my best to apply for a master program in computer science or software engineering or relative field.</p>

<h2 id="academic-experience">Academic Experience</h2>

<p>The following chapter will be the project I have gone through. I will not list them all but something I feel valuable to my college life. I have no intent to talk more about the technique, but the experience I got from them. That would be like a story, if you want to know the project list, may be you can find it in my CV.</p>

<p>In the first year when I came to the university. I just like a bird out of cage. Experienced the college entrance examination. I did not being interested in any lesson, so I got a really pool academic performence. But luckly this kind of situation changed when I up to the second year. I took part in an exam which held to choose students into a special class funded by the Guangzhou government for invent some electronic device for middle school&#39;s science education. Fortunately, I was in. At that place, I began my predestination with coding. As we all know that, electronic need code to instruct their working mode. In my team which I am so proud of I was responsable for writing and code for Arduino. Also, I had the chance to learn C and Java. That was the beginning of my coding life.</p>

<p>My first project was to design a forklift truck system. It required us to create a system contain both software and hardware component. In the software side, we wrote an app in Android to communicate with the hardware side in this case we used  Arduino and control it. In the hardware side, we combined  serval kind of sensors. To be honest, I do not get much more software development experience from it. But from this project I got in touch with Android and made a decision that chose Java as first programming language instead of C which I learn before. Now, I am appreciate my choice and enjoy coding in Java, if you ask me what I regret most it would be I have’t chose my major in CS and in China education system, there is so difficult to change your major.</p>

<p>In the following time, I also participated in serval project what impressed me most was the series we did for the disable people for help their daily life and entertainment. My team developed two productions, one is for help blind people to search their stuff quickly the other is for the blind children to entertain in the spare time. In these two project, I mainly took up the mission for the stm32 development, in other words, writing the code for stm32 to realize the needed function. In order to know what the blind people ’s life is, my team and I did deep investigation in Guangzhou Blind Children School. Rather than the profession knowledge I got,  I think learning how to communicate with them will be much more important and valuable. We really need to put more attention to the disable people, especially  in the education domain. Also at this year, I made up my mind to pursue an master from an oversea university.</p>

<p>Time went to the third year, and I became a junior student in the college. This year, I was preparing for the IELTS test and continued to enrich my knowledge and experience in programming. Also, I have to keep my major lesson in a normal line even push up my GPA. So, that wqs really a hard year for me. In my spare time, I finished two projects and one will be completed in May,2016. Let’s talk about two I have already finished. They all some kind of obstacle avoidance and remote control productions, one is a car and the other is a robot. But I was responsible for different kinds of job (you can find them in my CV). What impressed me most was that I learned how to design the libraries structure using the object-oriented thinking pattern and I got the chance to put it into practice. I have finish a supported libraries for the robot based on Arduino Mega 2560. It ran well and successful.  And the other gain is about the team work and team management. In one of this two project, I was the team leader during the development. So, I have to set up the rule and distribute the job to every one in the team in order to make sure the plan can be executed  smoothly and efficiently. I believe that would be a cherish experience when I work in no wonder the company or the research group in the future.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more is that, I began to learn Android development officically. In the end of this year, I have finished all the bascial experiment and tried to write some samll applicant. My first ideal is to write an app for our domitory, I hope it can be used for maneger out dorm&#39;s outlay instead of our current system which is manager by paper and pen.</p>

<p>Sincerely, I thanks my university for that I can get these chances to join in different kinds of project and know lots of friend with same interest. Went through all these project, I find what I am interested in and how to equip myself with profession skills. Also it help me to  set up a goal of career life.</p>

<h2 id="research-study-pathway">Research / Study Pathway</h2>

<p>There are three distinct study and research pathways that I wish to make use of in graduate studies: Android, Java, and web development.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I believe mobile devices will be the main equipments human being relying on instead of the personal computer. So, Android as their operation system must play an significant role in that time. Its development skill is full of  potential.In Android, I am especially interested in using its open source platform to develop smart home applications and have actually already drafted the undergraduate thesis proposal for a “smart home controlling system based on Android” that a department faculty member at my university would be willing to fund.</p>

<p>While Java as the primary language of choice for Android development is essential for almost any career choice I make in my future, and to enrich the user experience I know I need to focus more broadly on web applications and development. For example, this summer break I wrote a small html5 application for my father’s company using jQuery ( a kind of libraries in javascript) and in doing so earned immense admiration for it. As well, I believe that html5 and css3 will be highly useful to learn more about. All three to some degree complement each other.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not just like coding. In my spare time, I also like reading, travelling, listening to the music, watching movies and sometime I will take part in some voluntary activities.</p>

<p>That is me, thank you for your patient to reading all of it.</p>

<p>Best wishes to you !</p>
