<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello, dear visitors. My name is Haotao Lai, also you can call me Eric.</p>
<p> &nbsp</p>
<p>
I'm from China, now I am a junior student in Guangzhou University, majored in Mechanical Automation Engineering. When I learned "C Language" I find that what I am really intersted in is programming but not mechanical. So, I spend my spare time in learing programming, in all languages what I like best is java. Now I am foucus on android, java and web (that is an order list). Of course, I do not just like coding. In my spare time, I also like reading, travelling, listening to the music, watching movies and sometime I will take part in some voluntary activities.
